2. Make sure you add all the tools to search path - otherwise you'll not be
able to use the automated build.

3. Compiling tools.

To compile all the necessary bits and pieces that come in source form go into 
the "components" folder and execute the "install.bat" command. This command 
makes one very important assumption that you have installed Delphi 7 in its 
default location (C:\Progra~1\Borland\Delphi7).

After execution you'll have all the tools compiled into the same folder as the
"install.bat" command itself and all the packages compiled to the default 
packages folder (C:\Progra~1\Borland\Delphi7\Projects\Bpl)

Copy the compiled tools somewhere within your path, for example C:\Windows

4. Install packages into the IDE.

Open Delphi IDE, from "Component" select "Install Packages...". 

On the "Packages" tab click "Add", navigate to 
C:\Progra~1\Borland\Delphi7\Projects\Bpl
and add the following packages:

JvUIBD7RPE.bpl
PascalScript_Core_D7_Personal.bpl
pxvcl_d7.bpl
SynEdit_D7_PE.bpl

5. Verify your installation.

To verify everything is configured properly execute ant in project root.
To verify your IDE is configured properly open the cfged\cfged.dpr project.
