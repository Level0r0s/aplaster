
Hints to program the AplaSter system.
-------------------------------------

1. Waiting loops.

   To program a waiting loop in the script the loop must have a call to 
   "Suspend" procedure to give the system a chance to process other messages.
   Even if the loop isn't looping forever it's good to call the "Suspend"
   procedure as it gives the system more flexibility. Otherwise, current 
   event handler is blocking the system as long as it's processing.
